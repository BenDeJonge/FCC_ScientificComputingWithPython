# FCC_ScientificComputingWithPython
 My solutions for the "Scientific Computing with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp.org. The course covers complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization. Visit the freecodecamp website for more info: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/

The following information about the projects is copied from the above website.

## Project 1
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

## Project 2
Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:
- a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
- a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
- (optional) a starting day of the week, case insensitive
The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.

## Project 3
Complete the Category class in budget.py. It should be able to instantiate objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment.

## Project 4
Use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

## Project 5 (to be finished)
Write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.
